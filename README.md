## About The Project

</p>
This is a short console app written as an exercise given in de udemy course C# Intermediate by Mosh Hamedani.
<br/>
<br/>
The app models a workflow engine that takes workflow objects and executes the methods they contain.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote all of the exercises for this course using the TDD approach of writing tests first and then production code.
The tests are written using xUnit and Fluent Assertions.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Mosh Hamedani for making a comprehensive and easy to follow course. :star:
<br/>

A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
The code was written in Visual Studio.<br/>
The test coverage was measured with JetBrains dotCover.

* [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)
* [xUnit](https://xunit.net)
* [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/)
* [dotCover](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/)

### Specifications
The given specifications were:
<br/>
<h2>Exercise: Design a workflow engine</h2>
Design a workflow engine that takes a workflow object and runs it. A workflow is a series of steps or activities. The workflow engine class should have one method called Run() that takes a workflow, and then iterates over each activity in the workflow and runs it.
<br/>
<br/>
We want our workflows to be extensible, so we can create new activities without impacting the existing activities.
<br/>
<br/>
Educational tip: we should represent the concept of an activity using an interface. Each activity should have a method called Execute(). The workflow engine does not care about the concrete implementation of activities. All it cares about is that these activities have a common interface: they provide a method called Execute(). The engine simply calls this method and this way it executes a series of activities in sequence.
<br/>
<br/>
For the purpose of this exercise, do not worry about these complexities. Simply use Console.WriteLine() in each of your activity classes.


## What I learned from this project
How to use interfaces to create loosely coupled systems with polymorphic behaviour.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio needs to be installed along with the dotnet core runtime and SDK
All can be installed by the Visual Studio installer.

* The installer can be found on this page 
```sh
[Visual Studio documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
```

### Installation

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to install the files
3. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mpbmpb/workflow.git
```
3. go to the workflow directory
```sh
cd workflow
```
4. run the app from the terminal
```
dotnet run
```
5. or find the workflow.sln file in your explorer and double click it.
   Visual Studio should take it from there.
